## Description
Group Project for Week 5, Java at Epicodus - A web-based platform to create and administer courses of all types.

A web-based platform that provides a space for teachers to upload courses that anyone can express interest in enrolling for online. Courses are not necessarily connected to each other meaningfully. The online platform is maintained and features are expanded by the software company that runs it.

*Distributed software that can be used by universities, schools and other educational institutions to manage their courses. Courses are connected to each other by the nature of the use of the software by the institution. Software is used and branding is customized by the buyer*
